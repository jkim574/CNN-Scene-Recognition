1. Setup a Python Virtual Environment: 

python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ~/PyTorch
Here the name of our virtual environment is PyTorch (you can use any other name if you want).

2. Activate the environment:

source ~/PyTorch/bin/activate
This will activate your virtual environment and your shell prompt is prefixed with (PyTorch).
